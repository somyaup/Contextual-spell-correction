# NLP-based Sentence Transformer Spell Correction

NLP-based Sentence Transformer Spell Correction is a code repository that provides a spell correction functionality using sentence transformers. It utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to suggest possible corrections for misspelled words within sentences, enhancing the accuracy and fluency of textual inputs.

## Features

- Powerful spell correction algorithm based on sentence transformers.
- Correction suggestions for misspelled words within sentences.
- Fine-tuning options to customize correction suggestions.
- Lightweight and easy integration into existing projects.
- Detailed documentation and usage examples.

## Installation

To incorporate the NLP-based Sentence Transformer Spell Correction code into your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/SentenceTransformerSpellCorrection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd SentenceTransformerSpellCorrection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Import the `spell_corrector` module in your code:

   ```python
   from spell_corrector import SentenceTransformerSpellCorrector
   ```

## Usage

Once you have imported the `spell_corrector` module, you can use the `SentenceTransformerSpellCorrector` class to correct misspelled words within sentences:

```python
corrector = SentenceTransformerSpellCorrector()
corrected_sentence = corrector.correct(sentence)
```

The `sentence` parameter should be a string representing the input sentence with possible misspelled words. The `correct` method will return the corrected sentence.

## Configuration

You can configure the correction algorithm by modifying the settings in the `config.py` file. Some available options include:

- `TOP_K`: Maximum number of correction suggestions to provide for each misspelled word.
- `MIN_SIMILARITY`: Minimum similarity score required for a correction suggestion to be considered valid.
- `LANGUAGE_MODEL`: Pre-trained language model to use for spell correction.

Feel free to adjust these settings based on your specific requirements.
